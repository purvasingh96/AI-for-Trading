Extending this to any number of dimensions is called the L2 norm.  So: $\\sqrt{\\sum_{1}^{n}(weight_i - indexWeight_i)^2}$  Can also be written as $\\left \\| \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{index} \\right \\|_2$.

You may also need to go long only, which means no shorting, so no negative weights.  So $x_i >0 $ for all $i$. you could save a variable as `[x >= 0, sum(x) == 1]`, where x was created using `cvx.Variable()`."
